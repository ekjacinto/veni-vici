# Web Development Project 4 - _Veni Vici - Valorant Edition_

Submitted by: **Ethan Jacinto**

This web app: **provides an interface for users to randomly generate/learn about VALORANT agents**

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implemented using TypeScript for improved code comprehension
- [x] Implemented with Tailwind for improved styling development

## Notes

One of the main challenges in creating this app was working with an API and displaying the associated data alongside its specified attributes. In addition, I found challenge in implementing style changes using Tailwind's various utility classes as well as the required functionality within the banlist.
